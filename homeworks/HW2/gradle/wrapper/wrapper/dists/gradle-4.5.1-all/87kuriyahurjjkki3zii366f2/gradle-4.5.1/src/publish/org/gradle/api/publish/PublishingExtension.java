/**
 * The configuration of how to “publish” the different components of a project.
 * <p>
 * This new publishing mechanism will eventually replace the current mechanism of upload tasks and configurations. At this time, it is an
 * incubating feature and under development.
 *
 * <p>
 * The PublishingExtension is a {@link org.gradle.api.plugins.DeferredConfigurable} model element, meaning that extension will be configured as late as possible in the build.
 * So any 'publishing' configuration blocks are not evaluated until either:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The project is about to execute, or</li>
 *     <li>he publishing extension is referenced as an instance, as opposed to via a configuration closure.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A 'publishing' configuration block does not need to dereference the publishing extension, and so will be evaluated late. eg:
 * <pre>
 *     publishing {
 *         publications { ... }
 *         repositories.maven { ... }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Any use that accesses the publishing extension as an instance does require the publishing extension to be realised, forcing all configuration blocks to be evaluated. eg:
 * <pre>
 *     publishing.publications { ... }
 *     publishing.repositories.maven { ... }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @since 1.3
