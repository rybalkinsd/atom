 * <li>Implementations must be thread-safe.
 * <li>Implementations should implement {@link org.gradle.tooling.internal.protocol.test.InternalTestExecutionConnection}. This is used by all consumer versions from 2.6-rc-1.
 * <li>Implementations should implement {@link InternalParameterAcceptingConnection}. This is used by all consumer versions from 4.4.
 * <li>Implementations should implement {@link InternalCancellableConnection#getModel(ModelIdentifier, InternalCancellationToken, BuildParameters)}.
 * This is used by all consumer versions from 2.1-rc-1.
 * </li>
 * <li>Implementations should implement {@link ConfigurableConnection}. This is used by all consumer versions from 1.2-rc-1.
 * <li>Implementations should implement {@link StoppableConnection}. This is used by all consumer versions from 2.2-rc-1.
 * <li>Implementations should provide a zero-args constructor. This is used by all consumer versions from 1.0-milestone-3.
 * <li>For backwards compatibility, implementations should implement {@link InternalCancellableConnection#run(InternalBuildAction, InternalCancellationToken, BuildParameters)}.
 * This is used by all consumer versions from 2.1-rc-1 to 4.3.
 * </li>
 * <li>For backwards compatibility, implementations should implement {@link InternalBuildActionExecutor}. This is used by all consumer versions from 1.8-rc-1 to 2.0.
 * <li>For backwards compatibility, implementations should implement {@link ModelBuilder}. This is used by all consumer versions from 1.6-rc-1 to 2.0.
 * <li>For backwards compatibility, implementations should implement {@link BuildActionRunner}. This is used by consumer versions from 1.2-rc-1 to 1.5.
 * <li>For backwards compatibility, implementations should implement {@link InternalConnection}. This is used by consumer versions from 1.0-milestone-8 to 1.1.
 * <li>For backwards compatibility, implementations should provide a {@code void configureLogging(boolean verboseLogging)} method. This is used by consumer versions
 * 1.0-rc-1 to 1.1.
 * </ul>
