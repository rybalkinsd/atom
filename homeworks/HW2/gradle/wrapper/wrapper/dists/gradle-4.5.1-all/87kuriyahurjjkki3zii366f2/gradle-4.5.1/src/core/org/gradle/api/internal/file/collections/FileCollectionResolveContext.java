     *     <li>{@link org.gradle.api.Task} - resolved to task.outputs.files
     *     <li>{@link org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskOutputs} - resolved to outputs.files
     *     <li>{@link MinimalFileSet} - wrapped as a {@link org.gradle.api.file.FileCollection}.
     *     <li>{@link MinimalFileTree} - wrapped as a {@link org.gradle.api.file.FileTree}.
     *     <li>{@link FileCollectionContainer} - recursively resolved.
